# 11ty-mindmap

> Markdown flavored mindmaps and Eleventy.

Playing with some Markdown->Mindmap conversions via [**markmap-lib**](https://markmap.js.org/).
Mindmaps are stored in ./src/mindmaps/ as Nunjucks templates and wrapped in a `{% mindmap %}` paired shortcode (which enables you to add more content before and after the mindmap or include multiple mindmaps on a single page).

## USAGE

This is an Eleventy site, so [after cloning this repo locally] you can run <kbd>npm run build</kbd> to build the site, or <kbd>npm run serve</kbd> to build and serve the site.

```sh
npm run serve
```
